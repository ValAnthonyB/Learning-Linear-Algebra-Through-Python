# Learning-Linear-Algebra-Through-Python
In this repository, I code up some essential concepts in linear algebra from Gilbert Strang's Introduction to Linear Algebra 5th Edition using Python.


01 
	* Visualizing 2-D and 3-D vectors using matplotlib
	* Computing dot products of vectors from scratch and using numpy.linalg
	* Computing matrix multiplication
