# Learning-Linear-Algebra-Through-Python
In this repository, I code up some essential concepts in linear algebra from **Gilbert Strang's Introduction to Linear Algebra 5th Edition** using Python.


***01 Basic Linear Algebra***
* Visualizing 2-D and 3-D vectors using matplotlib
* Computing dot products of vectors from scratch and using numpy.linalg
* Computing matrix multiplication


***02 Elimination***
* Gaussian elimination of a square matrix using forward elimination
* Gaussian elimination of a square matrix using elementary matrices
* Row exchange
* Matrix Inverse
* LU and LDU factorization
* Transpose


***03 Projections and Least Squares***
* Gram-Schmidt Orthonormalization
* Fitting data points using least squares


***04 Eigenvalues***
* Computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors numerically


***05 Image Segmentation with the use of Graph Theory***
* Segment an image with pixels that are alike


***06 Singular Value Decomposition***
* Computing the compact SVD
* Geometry of the SVD
* Truncated SVD
* Image compression


***07 Facial Recognition using the Eigenfaces Method***
* Match an unknown face with a face in an image database
* Utilizes the compact SVD and projections
